    Return the loss of the discriminator given inputs.
    Parameters:
        gen: the generator model, which returns an image given z-dimensional noise
        disc: the discriminator model, which returns a single-dimensional prediction of real/fake
        criterion: the loss function, which should be used to compare 
               the discriminator's predictions to the ground truth reality of the images 
               (e.g. fake = 0, real = 1)
        real: a batch of real images
        num_images: the number of images the generator should produce, 
                which is also the length of the real images
        z_dim: the dimension of the noise vector, a scalar
        device: the device type

        disc_loss: a torch scalar loss value for the current batch
